# Applied-Machine-Learning-Practicum

## Took ECE310 - Applied Machine Learning Practicum during my exchange in Drexel University Spring 2024

### Assignment 1: Pipelines and Models in Scikit Learn with Real Exchange Rate Data
- Create preprocessing pipelines and ML models to predict Real Exchange Rate Data

### Assignment 2: Transfer Learning for Fine-Grained Image Classification
- Use transfer learning to perform image classification on 2 datasets (102 oxford flowers and BirdVsSquirrel dataset)

### Assignment 3:  Reinforcement Learning with TF-Agents
- Do RL on 2 atari games and create videos on the gameplay of the agents built.

### Assignment 4: Generative Image Models
- With the help of a pre-trained deep image segmentation model, do image segementation and replace the bird in the original image.

### Assignment 5: Sentiment Analysis with Text Models
-  Build and train a model that predicts whether or not a review for a movie from tensorflow IMDB dataset indicates the movie was liked, or was not liked
